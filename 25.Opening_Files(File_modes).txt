* Just so this isn't clear to ppl, just opening a file in "w" IMMEDIATELY erases the contents that were already there.

Here there are all the available modes of the function "open" with relative meaning.
'r'       open for reading (default)
'w'       open for writing, truncating the file first
'x'       create a new file and open it for writing
'a'       open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists
'b'       binary mode
't'       text mode (default)
'+'       open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)
